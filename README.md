# Prep Cost Effectiveness

In this project I analyaze public data from the CDC, academic papers, and pharmeceutical 
organizations to better understand HIV and its' trends over the last decade. 

I pay close attention to the role PrEP may play in curbing diagnoses for certain groups, 
and it's potential to save the United States billions of dollars each year.
