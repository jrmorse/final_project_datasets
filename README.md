## Prep Cost Effectiveness

In this project I analyaze public data from the CDC, academic papers, and pharmeceutical 
organizations to better understand HIV and its' trends over the last ~15 years. 

I pay close attention to the role PrEP may play in curbing diagnoses for certain groups, 
and it's potential to save the United States billions of dollars each year.

# Repo

My raw data sets from the CDC along with other sources live in the folder titled "Data_Sets".
New tables were created and the data was cleaned in the rmd file titled "datasets". All of
this cleaned data was then saved as CSVs and used in my shiny app (app.r). Images for my 
shiny app were pulled from the web and are housed in the folder titled "graphics".
