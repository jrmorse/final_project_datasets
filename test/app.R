                                                   innovations have played a pivotal role in changing the perception of the
                                                   diagnosis of HIV from a death sentence to that of a chronic condition. In 2012,
                                                   the United States witnessed the approval of a new drug that was able to prevent
                                                   the onset of HIV for at risk individuals. With, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
                                                   medication, high risk individuals have been able to live without contracting
                                                   HIV, thus saving millions of dollars each year for the U.S. healthcare system.

                                                   financial resources must be directed towards treatment. In my study, I aim to
